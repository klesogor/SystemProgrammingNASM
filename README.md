# SystemProgrammingNASM #
*You might need to install NASM(https://www.nasm.us/), and 32-bit C library(https://www.codeweavers.com/support/wiki/Diag/MissingLibC)*<br />
*5 labs. 5 reports. One discipline(System programming)*<br />
You are interested in 00,01,lab02-c,03 directories. <br />
First two labs is shitty, but 02-c and 03 is good. lab03 contains macroses, they were counted as lab04.<br />
Each lab contains reports and diagrams. Contact me for diagrams copy at Draw.IO lab02-c and 03 contains makefile to make your life easier. <br /> Assembly flavor is NASM, default for linux.<br /><br />
Have fun ;)
