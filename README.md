# SystemProgrammingNASM
*5 labs. 5 reports. One discipline(System programming)*

You are interested in 00,01,02-c,03 directories. 
First two labs is shitty, but 02-c and 03 is good. lab03 contains macros, they were counted as lab04.
Each lab contains reports. lab02-c and 03 contains makefile to make your life easier. Assembly flavor is NASM, default for linux.
Have fun ;)
