# SystemProgrammingNASM
* 5 labs. 5 reports. One discipline(System programming) 02 is shitty version of 3-d lab, consider its depricated. Go for lab02-c *
You are interested in 00,01,02-c,03 directories. 
First two labs is shitty, but 02-c and 03 is good. lab03 contains macroses, they were counted as lab04.
Each lab contains reports and diagrams. Contact me for diagrams copy at Draw.IO lab02-c and 03 contains makefile to make your life easier. Assembly flavor is NASM, default for linux.
Have fun ;)
